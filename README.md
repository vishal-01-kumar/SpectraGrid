Welcome to SpectraGrid, an intelligent diagnostic platform designed to transform transformer health monitoring through AI-driven Frequency Response Analysis (FRA).

SpectraGrid enables power engineers to analyze, visualize, and interpret FRA data from multiple vendors in a unified interface ‚Äî helping detect mechanical and electrical faults like winding deformation, core displacement, or insulation degradation with speed and precision. ‚öôÔ∏è

üìú Problem Statement

Traditional FRA analysis is complex and time-consuming, requiring expert interpretation and comparison with baseline data.
Moreover, the lack of data format standardization across OEMs (Omicron, Doble, Megger, etc.) makes analysis inefficient.

The challenge:
To design a unified software solution that can ingest multi-format FRA data, perform AI-based analysis, and deliver automated fault classification and maintenance recommendations ‚Äî even without baseline signatures.

üöÄ Our Solution ‚Äî SpectraGrid

SpectraGrid bridges the gap between electrical diagnostics and artificial intelligence.
It‚Äôs a web-based platform that performs FRA data parsing, preprocessing, visualization, and intelligent fault analysis.

Key Objectives Achieved:

Standardization of multi-vendor FRA formats (CSV, XML, proprietary binaries)

Automated feature extraction and classification using ML models

Fault interpretation through explainable AI logic

Intuitive dashboards for engineers and asset managers

By leveraging machine learning and signal analytics, SpectraGrid reduces reliance on expert judgment and enables predictive, data-driven transformer maintenance.
